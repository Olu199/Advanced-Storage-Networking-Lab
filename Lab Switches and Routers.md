# Network Setup Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about the configuration and setup of the `mgmt`, `storage`, `storage interconnect`, and `data` devices within the network. Each device has specific roles and responsibilities to ensure proper routing, NAT, and communication between various network segments.

### Device Roles
- **Management (`mgmt`) Device:** Handles overall network management, routing, and SSH access.
- **Storage (`storage`) Device:** Manages storage subnets and routes traffic to the storage network.
- **Storage Interconnect:** Acts as a cluster switch for creating inter-cluster networks, with only the interconnect address needed.
- **Data (`data`) Device:** Manages the data traffic network and routes traffic between storage and management networks.

## 1. Device Configurations

### 1.1 `mgmt` Device
