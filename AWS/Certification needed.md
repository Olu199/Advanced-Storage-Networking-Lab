The AWS certifications you mentioned are highly specialized and respected in the industry, especially for roles involving cloud architecture, DevOps, and security. If you're pursuing these AWS certifications, they are typically considered sufficient for demonstrating expertise in their respective areas, particularly within the context of AWS environments.

However, here’s how CompTIA certifications might complement these AWS certifications:

### 1. **AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Professional**
   - **Complementary CompTIA Cert:** **CompTIA Network+** or **CompTIA Security+**
   - **Reason:** While the AWS certification covers cloud architecture extensively, Network+ can strengthen your foundational networking knowledge, which is crucial for understanding how cloud services interact with traditional network infrastructure. Security+ would enhance your knowledge of fundamental security principles, complementing the security aspects covered in the AWS Solutions Architect certification.

### 2. **AWS Certified DevOps Engineer – Professional**
   - **Complementary CompTIA Cert:** **CompTIA Linux+** or **CompTIA Cloud+**
   - **Reason:** The AWS certification focuses on DevOps practices within the AWS environment. Linux+ would be beneficial if you’re working heavily with Linux systems, which are common in DevOps environments. Cloud+ could further solidify your understanding of cloud technologies, especially if you work with multi-cloud or hybrid environments.
