This concept refers specifically to networking:

- **Public Service**: A service that can be accessed from anywhere on the internet, such as AWS S3.
- **Private Service**: A service that can only be accessed by devices connected to a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

**Network Zones:**

1. **AWS Private Zone**: This includes resources like EC2 instances within a VPC. These resources are isolated and can only connect to each other or the internet if explicitly allowed by the configuration, similar to a home network that connects to the internet only through a router.
  
2. **AWS Public Zone**: This includes services like S3 buckets that are accessible from the public internet.

3. **Public Internet Zone**: This refers to the general public internet, which includes access to public services like AWS S3, email, and websites like YouTube.

AWS provides a **private zone** (VPC), often referred to as a virtual private cloud, where resources are isolated and cannot communicate with each other or the internet unless permissions are granted. This is analogous to a home network, which can access the internet only if configured to do so, and vice versa.

AWS also has an **internet zone** that provides connectivity to the broader public internet. Additionally, there is an **AWS public zone** where public-facing AWS services, like S3, operate. This zone is a network within AWS that is directly connected to the public internet, enabling services to be accessible globally.
