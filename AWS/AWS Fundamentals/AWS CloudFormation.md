**AWS CloudFormation: Managing Infrastructure as Code**

AWS CloudFormation allows you to manage, create, update, and delete infrastructure resources in AWS using a template-based approach. These templates can be written in either YAML or JSON. YAML, while more human-readable, can be prone to errors but offers additional functionality.

### What Makes a CloudFormation Template:

- **Resources**: Every template must include a list of resources, which is the only mandatory section. Resources define the AWS components you want to create, update, or delete. When you add resources, AWS creates them; when you remove them, AWS deletes them; and when you update them, AWS applies the updates.

- **Description**: A text field that allows the template author to explain the purpose and functionality of the template to its users.

- **AWSTemplateFormatVersion**: Specifies the version of the CloudFormation template format. If included alongside a description, the `AWSTemplateFormatVersion` must appear first, followed by the description. This field helps AWS to maintain backward compatibility over time.

- **Metadata**: Controls how different elements in the CloudFormation template are presented in the AWS Management Console. You can use metadata to enforce specific UI presentations.

- **Parameters**: Enables you to define user input fields. For example, you can prompt the user for the size of an EC2 instance or the number of Availability Zones to deploy.

- **Mappings**: Used to create lookup tables, allowing you to map keys to corresponding values, such as region-specific AMI IDs.

- **Conditions**: Enables decision-making within the template. Conditions are evaluated based on user-defined parameters, and resources or properties are created or omitted depending on the result (true/false).

- **Outputs**: Provides a way to display the results or outcomes after the template has been executed, such as the public IP address of an EC2 instance or the ARN of a newly created resource.

### CloudFormation Template Example:

```yaml
Resources:
  MyInstance:
    Type: 'AWS::EC2::Instance'
    Properties:
      ImageId: 'ami-0abcdef1234567890'
```

In this template:
- **Resources**: The template has a `Resources` section with one resource, `MyInstance`.
- **Type**: The `Type` specifies the kind of AWS resource, in this case, an EC2 instance.
- **Properties**: Specifies properties for the resource, such as the AMI ID.

When CloudFormation processes this template, it creates a **stack**. A stack is a collection of AWS resources defined in the template. CloudFormation keeps the logical resources (defined in the template) in sync with their corresponding physical resources (the actual AWS components). If you update the stack, CloudFormation updates the physical resources. If you delete the stack, CloudFormation deletes the associated physical resources.
