| **Thick Provisioning** | | Thick LUNs | Thick Volumes | Thick Volumes | Thick Provisioned Disk | **This is like saving a certain amount of space in advance for something important, even if you’re not using it yet.** |
| **Thin Provisioning** | | Thin LUNs | Thin Volumes | Thin Volumes | Thin Provisioned Disk | **This is like starting with a small space for something, but you can get more space if you need it.** |
| **Space Reservation** | | Reserved Capacity (Unity) | Reserved Space (3PAR) | Reserved Capacity | VMFS/NFS Reserved Space | **Making sure there’s enough space set aside for something important, like reserving seats for a movie.** |
| **Quality of Service (QoS)** | | FAST VP / FAST Cache | Adaptive QoS | QoS | Storage I/O Control (SIOC) | **This makes sure that important things get done first, like making sure the teacher answers your question before others.** |
| **Data Deduplication** | | Deduplication (Unity/PowerMax) | Deduplication | Deduplication | Deduplication (vSAN, VMFS/NFS via plugins) | **This is a way to remove duplicate copies of data, so you don’t waste space. It’s like only keeping one copy of the same photo.** |
| **Compression** | | Compression (Unity/PowerMax) | Compression | Compression | vSAN Compression / Deduplication | **Making data smaller so it takes up less space, like squishing a pillow to fit it in a small bag.** |
| **Compaction** | | Data Reduction (Unity) | Data Compaction | Data Reduction | vSAN Space Efficiency | **This is like making sure everything is packed tightly, so there’s no wasted space.** |
| **High Availability** | | PowerMax SRDF/HA | HPE 3PAR Persistent Ports | ActiveCluster | vSphere HA / FT | **This ensures that a service or data is always available, even if something breaks. It’s like having a backup plan if something goes wrong.** |
| **Cluster** | | VPLEX Cluster | HPE Cluster Extension | FlashStack (with Cisco UCS) | VMware Cluster | **A group of connected systems that work together as one, like a team of students working on a group project.** |
| **Node** | | PowerMax Node | HPE Node | FlashArray Controller Node | ESXi Host Node | **One part of a cluster, like one student in a group project.** |
| **Disk Shelves** | | VMAX DAEs | HPE Drive Enclosures | N/A (Managed within external storage arrays) | N/A (Managed within external storage arrays) | **These are like the shelves in a library where books (data) are stored.** |
| **File Storage** | | Isilon / Unity NAS | HPE StoreEasy | FlashBlade | vSAN File Services / NFS/SMB Datastores | **Storing data in files, like saving documents on your computer.** |
| **Block Storage** | | PowerMax / VMAX / Unity Block | 3PAR / Primera / Nimble | FlashArray | VMFS Datastores / RDM | **Storing data in blocks, which is like having building blocks that can be arranged to store information.** |
| **Object Storage** | | ECS (Elastic Cloud Storage) | HPE Apollo / Scality | FlashBlade / Pure ObjectEngine | vSAN Object Store (via plugins) | **Storing data as objects, like putting different things into labeled boxes.** |
| **Storage Grid** | | ECS (Elastic Cloud Storage) | HPE Apollo / Scality | Pure Storage FlashBlade | N/A (Typically managed outside of VMware ESXi) | **A system that stores data across many places so it’s safe and easy to access, like a big network of warehouses.** |
| **S3 Compatible Storage** | | ECS (Elastic Cloud Storage) | HPE Apollo / Scality | FlashBlade / Pure ObjectEngine | vCloud Director Object Storage Extension | **Storage that works with the S3 protocol, which is a way to store and access data over the internet, like storing files in the cloud.** |
