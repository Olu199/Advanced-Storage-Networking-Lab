**What is DNSSEC?**
- **DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions)** is an add-on to DNS (Domain Name System) that provides two main security features:
  1. **Data Origin Authentication**: Ensures that the DNS data comes from the correct source (the specified DNS zone).
  2. **Data Integrity Protection**: Confirms that the DNS data has not been altered during transit.

**Key Features of DNSSEC:**
- **Chain of Trust**: DNSSEC creates a chain of trust from the root zone down to the individual records, using **public key cryptography**. This allows verification that the child zone is secure and not compromised.
- **Additive Security**: DNSSEC adds security features on top of the existing DNS system. It doesn’t replace DNS but enhances it by adding the ability to verify data integrity and authenticity.
- **Compatibility**: Devices that support DNSSEC will perform both DNS and DNSSEC queries, while those that don’t support DNSSEC will only perform DNS queries.

**Understanding DNSSEC Components:**
- **RRSET (Resource Record Set)**: A group of DNS records of the same type and name within a DNS zone (e.g., all MX records in a zone).
- **Zone Signing Key (ZSK)**: 
  - A private key used to create a digital signature (RRSIG) for the RRSETs, ensuring their integrity.
  - The corresponding public key is stored in the DNSKEY record.
- **Key Signing Key (KSK)**:
  - A private key used to sign the DNSKEY record itself, which contains the ZSK public key.
  - The public part of the KSK is also stored in the DNSKEY record and is linked to the parent zone, creating a secure chain of trust.

**How DNSSEC Works:**
1. **Signing Records**:
   - The **ZSK** signs each RRSET to create an **RRSIG** (a digital signature).
   - The **KSK** signs the DNSKEY record, which includes the public ZSK.
2. **Verification**:
   - A DNS resolver (client) checks the integrity of the RRSET by verifying the RRSIG using the ZSK public key from the DNSKEY record.
   - The authenticity of the DNSKEY record is verified using the public KSK, which is trusted due to the chain of trust from the parent zone.
3. **Trust and Flexibility**:
   - **DNSSEC** allows changes to the ZSK without impacting the parent zone, thanks to the separate signing of DNSKEY by the KSK.
