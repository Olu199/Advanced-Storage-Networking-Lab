### 19-02 Data Protection Overview
- **ONTAP Data Protection:** Ensures data remains available in cases of hardware/software failure, site failure, data corruption, or accidental deletion.
- **ONTAP Hardware Redundancy:** Redundant components ensure the system withstands single hardware component failures.
- **Redundant Hardware Components:** Include controllers, disk shelves, disk shelf cables, and disks.
- **Disk Redundancy:** Uses RAID to protect against disk failure; RAID-DP protects against two disks failing in a RAID group, RAID-TEC protects against three.
- **Disk Shelf Redundancy:** SyncMirror mirrors data across separate shelves, optional, but requires twice as many disks.
- **Disk Shelf Cable Redundancy:** Uses Multi-Path High Availability (MPHA).
- **Controller Redundancy:** Controllers are arranged in HA pairs, ensuring continuity even if a controller fails.
- **Physical Site Redundancy:** MetroCluster and SnapMirror replicate data between physical sites.
- **RPO and RTO:** MetroCluster offers zero RPO and fast RTO; SnapMirror options vary based on synchronous or asynchronous configurations.
- **Backup:** SnapVault is used for backup, while SnapMirror is primarily for DR.
- **SnapCenter:** Provides central management of DR, Backup, Restore, and Clone operations, with third-party integration options like CommVault, Veeam, etc.【22†source】

### 19-03 SyncMirror
- **SyncMirror:** Provides redundancy for disk shelves by mirroring aggregates across two mirrored sets of disks (plexes). Requires twice as many disks.
- **Plexes:** Two mirrored sets of disks in a SyncMirror aggregate.
- **Pools:** SyncMirror requires disks to be divided into Pool 0 and Pool 1 for the plexes.
- **SyncMirror Recovery:** If a plex fails, the other plex serves the data until the failed plex is repaired and resynced.【15†source】

### 19-05 High Availability
- **High Availability Configurations:** Include single-node clusters, two-node clusters, switched clusters with even-numbered HA pairs, and MetroCluster.
- **Controller Failure Scenario:** HA pairs take over the disks and data service of failed controllers.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Ensures data availability through takeovers during node failures.
- **Non-Disruptive Maintenance:** Maintenance and upgrades can be performed without disrupting data service.
- **Non-Disruptive ONTAP Upgrades:** Nodes are upgraded one at a time within an HA pair.
- **Sizing:** Nodes should run at a maximum of 50% capacity to ensure no performance degradation during takeover events.
- **Takeover and Giveback:** HA configurations ensure minimal downtime during planned and unplanned events.
- **LIF Failover:** Ensures clients maintain connectivity to NAS IP addresses during takeovers.【20†source】

### 19-06 The RDB Replicated Database, Quorum and Epsilon

### 19-10 Load Sharing Mirrors
- **Load Sharing Mirrors (LS Mirrors):** Mirror copies of FlexVol NAS volumes for redundancy and load balancing within the same cluster.
- **Redundancy:** LS mirrors provide read redundancy automatically; write requests go to the source volume.
- **Use Cases:** Best for small volumes with frequent reads but infrequent updates.
- **SVM Root Volumes:** Recommended to create LS mirrors for each NAS SVM root volume on each node of the cluster.【19†source】

### 19-11 SnapMirror Engine Configuration
