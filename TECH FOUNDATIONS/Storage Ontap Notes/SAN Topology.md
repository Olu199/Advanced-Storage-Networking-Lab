1. **Point-to-Point:**
    
    - Direct connection between the server and the storage device.
    - Simple but limited in scalability.
2. **Fibre Channel Arbitrated Loop (FC-AL):**
    
    - A loop-based topology where all devices share a single loop. Only one device can transmit data at a time.
    - Not commonly used due to limitations in performance and scalability.
3. **Switched Fabric (Fibre Channel Fabric):**
    
    - The most common SAN topology, using Fibre Channel switches to interconnect devices.
    - Allows multiple simultaneous connections, high scalability, and redundancy.
4. **Mesh Topology:**
    
    - Each switch is connected to multiple other switches, providing multiple paths for data to travel between any two points in the network.
    - Provides high redundancy and fault tolerance.
5. **Core-Edge Topology:**
    
    - A hierarchical topology where edge switches connect servers and core switches connect storage devices.
    - Scalable and efficient, typically used in large SAN environments.
