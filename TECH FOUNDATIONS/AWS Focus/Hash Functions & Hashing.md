Hashing is a process where an algorithm is used to convert files or data into a fixed-length representation, often referred to as a hash. This process is crucial in various applications, such as:

- Digital signatures
- Data integrity verification
- Cryptocurrencies
- Password storage
- File verification

**How Hashing Works**

Hashing begins with a **hash function**. Some examples of widely used hash functions include **MD5** and **SHA-256**. The core principle of a hash function is that it takes an input (the digital representation of data) and produces a fixed-size output, commonly known as a hash or digest.

Key characteristics of a hash function include:

1. **Deterministic**: The same input will always produce the same hash value.
2. **Non-reversible**: Hashing is a one-way process. You cannot reconstruct the original data from its hash.
3. **Unique**: Any change in the input data, even a single bit, will result in a completely different hash.
4. **Collision-resistant**: It is computationally infeasible for two different inputs to produce the same hash value.

**Collisions and Security Concerns**

A **collision** occurs when two different inputs produce the same hash value. This is a critical flaw because it undermines the hash function's integrity. For example, the MD5 hash function, once widely used, has been found to be vulnerable to collisions, making it less secure for modern cryptographic applications.
