| **Feature**                     | **Description**                                                                                                                                                   | **Key Commands/Settings**                                                   | **Notes**                                                                      |                                                                                       |                                                      |

| **Thin Provisioning**           | Allows presenting more logical storage to clients than the physical storage available, dynamically allocating space as data is written.                           | -                                                                           | Requires active monitoring of space utilization.                               |                                                                                       |                                                      |
| **Thick Provisioning**          | Preallocates storage space upfront. Each LUN is guaranteed its space, preventing other objects from using it.                                                     | `volume create -space-slo thick`<br>`space-slo thick`                       | Suitable for mission-critical workloads.                                       |                                                                                       |                                                      |
| **Semi-Thick Provisioning**     | Uses thick-provisioned volumes with space-reserved LUNs and a fractional reserve of 0%. Provides a "best effort" overwrite guarantee with some space savings.     | `volume create -space-slo semi-thick`<br>`-space-slo semi-thick`            | **Best effort overwrite**: Tries to ensure overwrites succeed by deleting snapshots if needed.<br>**Space reserve**: Ensures space is reserved for the LUN, preventing other objects from using it. Requires less upfront storage space than fully thick provisioning. |
| **LUN Space Reservation**       | Guarantees space for the LUN in the volume, preventing other objects from using it. When disabled, space is allocated as needed, allowing overprovisioning.       | `lun modify -vserver name -volume name -lun name -space-reserve enabled`<br>`disabled` | Behavior changes with thin-provisioned volumes; behaves like non-space-reserved LUNs. |                                                                                       |                                                      |
| **Fractional Reserve**          | Reserves space for Snapshot copy overwrites. Must be set to either 0% or 100%.                                                                                    | `volume create -fractional-reserve 0`<br>`100`                               | 100% requires significant additional space; 0% provides "best effort" guarantee.      |                                                      |
| **Space Reclamation**           | Reclaims space automatically when host deletes data, notifying the host when the LUN cannot accept writes due to lack of space.                                   | `lun modify -vserver name -volume name -lun name -space-allocation enabled` | Prevents space utilization reporting issues.                                   |                                                                                       |                                                      |
| **Volume Provisioning Types**   | Different options include thick, semi-thick, and thin provisioning.                                                                                               | `volume create -space-slo thick`<br>`semi-thick`<br>`none`                  | Choose based on technical and business requirements.                          |                                                                                       |                                                      |
| **Snapshot Management**         | Manages space utilization by controlling how snapshots are stored and deleted. Autodelete can be enabled to prevent overwrites from failing due to lack of space. | `volume snapshot autodelete modify`                                         | Autogrow can be enabled to minimize the chance of snapshots being autodeleted. |                                                                                       |                                                      |
| **Space Utilization Reporting** | Hosts and storage may report used space differently. Space reclamation ensures correct reporting and efficient space utilization.                                 | -                                                                           | Ensures host and storage systems report space usage accurately.                |                                                                                       |                                                      |
| **Default Settings**            | CLI defaults for volume creation align with thick provisioning and 100% fractional reserve. GUI settings may vary.                                                | `volume create -space-slo thick`<br>`System Manager Volume Create Wizard`   | GUI settings differ for semi-thick and thin provisioning.                      |                                                                                       |                                                      |
| **Windows to UNIX Mapping**     | Process of mapping a Windows authenticated user to a UNIX user account for domain authenticated users.                                                            | -                                                                           | Ensures appropriate mapping and verification for security and access control.  | Domain Admins are mapped to root by default. If no mapping, default account is used.  |                                                      |

### Additional Details

- **Thin Provisioning Monitoring:** Requires active monitoring of space utilization to avoid running out of physical disk space while clients report free space available【7†source】【10†source】.
- **Space Reclamation:** Prevents issues where used capacity never decreases from the storage system perspective, ensuring efficient space utilization and avoiding false full volume reporting【8†source】.
- **Fractional Reserve Settings:** Setting to 100% guarantees overwrite success but requires significant additional space. Setting to 0% offers a "best effort" guarantee but may not be suitable for high change rate environments【9†source】【10†source】.
- **Windows to UNIX Mapping Process**:
  - **Windows Authentication**: Starts with a user authenticated on a Windows domain.
  - **Check Mapping**: Checks for a predefined mapping from the Windows domain\user to a UNIX username.
  - **Mapping Exists**: Uses the mapped UNIX user account if verified.
  - **No Mapping**: Tries to use the Windows user directly as a UNIX user if no predefined mapping exists.
  - **Domain Admins**: Mapped to the root user on UNIX by default.
  - **Use Default Account**: Uses a default account (e.g., 'pcuser' with UID & GID 65534) if no verification.
  - **Outcome**: User is either accepted or considered invalid based on verification and mapping.
