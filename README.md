# Advanced-Storage-Networking-Lab
While others will benefit from this configuration, I designed this lab specifically for storage network engineers and administrators

This guide provides detailed instructions for setting up a Proxmox lab environment. It covers everything from initial setup to advanced configurations, making it suitable for students at any stage of their career. This document is modular and can be easily updated or forked for improvements and additional information. I designed this lab specifically for storage network engineers and administrators; however, the lab is cross-functional.
