### Proxmox Lab Setup Guide

This guide provides a framework for setting up a Proxmox lab environment. While specific hardware specifications are provided, it is optional to follow them exactly. The critical requirement is to ensure you have enough Ethernet ports, compute resources, and storage resources to make this setup work.

By following this guide, you will be able to set up a robust and efficient Proxmox lab environment with an isolated intercluster network for ONTAP nodes. Ensure you have the necessary resources in terms of Ethernet ports, compute power, and storage capacity to meet the needs of your setup. If you have any specific requirements or need further assistance with configurations, feel free to ask!
